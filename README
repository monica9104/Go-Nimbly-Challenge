How does it work

This app just takes a string (the one you should enter in the search bar on the UI),
makes a request to https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/ in order to get the first location that matches your search text
and after that, it makes another request to https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/ in order to get all the weather records for today.

How to run locally

In order to run it locally, you just have to clone the repository to your local machine
After that, you should run inside the root folder the command npm install to download the used dependencies,
And finally, just execute the npm start command or just use node index.js (on your local machine the server will use port 4242
by default)
